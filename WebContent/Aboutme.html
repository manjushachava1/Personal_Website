					I am a 16 year old Junior at <a href="http://www.massacademy.org/"
						target="_blank"> Mass Academy of Math and Science</a> and an avid
					enthusiast of Coldplay, The Flash, and pizza. <br> <br>

					<p>I live in Tyngsboro, MA, but because no one knows where
					that is, it is near Lowell, MA. If you don't know where Lowell is
					either, then you should probably look it up on

					My sending school was <a href="http://www.chelmsford.k12.ma.us/chs"
						target="_blank">Chelmsford High School</a>, which is located in
					Chelmsford, MA, a town neighboring Tyngsboro. I loved CHS
					because of the faculty, the sense of community, and of course, my
					friends. Leaving Chelmsford High was tough because it meant I would
					have to start over. Losing not only my friends, but the connections
					I had with many of my teachers made me feel sad. Being the risk
					taker I was, I wanted to challenge myself and try something new.<br>
					<br> The end result was my enrollment into Mass Academy.

			<div id="foo" class="about">
				<p>
					I play three instruments; violin, guitar, and piano. I have been
					playing the violin since I was in 4th grade and I loved it all my
					life. I was section leader of the violin section during my time in
					high school orchestra, as well as 1st seat and sometimes soloist
					for some of the pieces. I participated in Chelmsford Symphony
					Orchestra, which was an after school club designed for students
					with a passion for music to play pieces which were far more
					advanced compared to the regular orchestra/band music. <br> 
					
					<br>Piano
					was an instrument I had a passion for since I was little. I hadn't
					delved into it until I was about 11 years old, which was when I got
					my first keyboard. I took lessons for more than a year and a half
					before stopping, for the reason that I wasn't able to allocate
					enough time for practice. Now piano has become a past time for me
					rather than a primary instrument, but I still love playing it to
					this day. <br> <br>My interest for guitar acquired from
					listening to bands like Green Day, and of course, Coldplay. I have
					always loved the sound of the guitar, but nothing inspired me to
					learn how to play it more than listening to songs mainly by these
					two bands. After begging my parents to buy me an acoustic guitar, I
					taught myself how to play many songs, as well as learn basic guitar
					chords. I struggle with barre chords, like many of the amateur
					guitar players, but hopefully I'll master those someday. <br>

					<br>In addition to playing instruments, I also enjoy singing.
					Whenever I have free time (which is almost never), I like to pick
					up my guitar and sing any song that matches my mood. Freshman year
					was the first time I joined an actual Chorus; before that, I had
					been in Orchestra my entire life. <br><br>The music teachers at
					CHS encouraged me to join their chorus. Although the Orchestra and
					Chorus classes ran during the same times of day, I was able to skip
					Orchestra on certain days to practice with the chorus. Singing with
					a group of people I admired made me forget my surroundings, and
					helped me relax greatly. The songs we practiced challenged my
					vocals and pushed me to practice harder. Unfortunately, I was not
					able to continue this wonderful experience in my sophomore year due
					to scheduling conflicts. However, being a part of something
					extraordinary truly had an impact on my life.

			<div class="about">
				<p>
					I developed a passion for sports ever since I was a little 'un. My
					entire family always comes together to watch every Patriots
					football game, and my brother, dad and I watch the rest of football
					games. I will admit that I'm not as impressive with my knowledge of
					NFL players and their statistics as well as my brother or other
					MAMS students, but I can still place in the top 3 in any Fantasy
					Football league. My favorite players on the Patriots are Edelman
					and Gronkowski for not only their matchless performances on the
					field, but also for their volunteer work for the community. My
					favorite players in the NFL who are not on the Patriots are A.J
					Green of the Bengals and Antonio Brown of the Steelers. <br> <br>I've
					played basketball my entire life up until Freshman year of high
					school, which was my last year. I was on my school's JV team and it
					was a challenging experience mentally. In the end, I was able to
					learn the true meaning of perseverance, as well as team work. <br>
					<br>During sophomore year of high school, I decided to try out
					for the tennis team. Prior to playing on my school's JV team, I had
					2 years of tennis experience. I enjoyed playing tennis for my
					school, and would have continued if I stayed at my sending school.

					<br> <br> Sports I play for fun include football and
					badminton. During my freshman year, a friend and I decided to pair
					up and compete in a school badminton tournament. There, we won
					first place after defeating many of the upperclassmen. Later on, I
					competed in another competition and placed 1st in doubles.
					Badminton is one of my favorite sports to play, and like all the
					other sports, I become extremely competitive when immersed.
