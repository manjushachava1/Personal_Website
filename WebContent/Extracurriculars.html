				<p>
					My extracurricular activities at my sending school were very
					varied. I was part of many different clubs, including Chelmsford
					Symphony Orchestra, Model UN, Class Representatives, Science Team,
					and Melting Pot (Cultural Club). I was able to receive the Rookie
					of the Year award in Environmental Council at the Model UN held at
					UMASS Lowell last year. That was such a wonderful experience,
					seeing as sophomore year was my first year of joining Model UN.
					Another acheivement of mine was being a member of the Symphony
					Board. I loved having a leadership position because it gave me a
					sense of responsibility. It was really fun for me to become
					involved in so many clubs because I felt closer and more aware of
					my school and my community, and I loved spending more time with my
					friends. <br> <br>In addition to afterschool clubs, I
					participated on the <a href="http://www.stormgears.org/"
						target="_blank">FRC team 5422 Stormgears</a> located in Westford,
					MA. Being a part of this team was one of the most amazing
					experiences of my life because my interest in robotics started
					here. I learned so many skills being a part of the electrical team,
					especially patience and resilience. Last year, 5422 qualified to
					compete in the World Championships, which was held at St. Louis.
					Being exposed to different ideas and strategies, as well as other
					teams helped me understand more about robotics than I would have
					ever imagined. <br> <br>This year at MAMS, I joined the
					Mock Trial Team, VEX Robotics, and Model UN. <br> <br>This
					is my first year doing Mock Trial because my previous school did
					not offer this extracurricular. It is such a wonderful experience
					because I really got to understand how our justice system works
					just by being in the position of a lawyer. My position in the team
					is Direct Examiner of one of the witnesses in a murder case. <br>
					<br>As I mentioned previously, I joined the Vex Robotics
					extracurricular, where (surprise) we build Vex Robots. These are
					medium sized robots that require just as much skill set as working
					with an FRC robot. Sadly, I do not have time to join Mass Academy's
					FRC Team 190, but if I did have time, I definitely would. <br>
					<br>Model UN at Mass Academy is pretty interesting, although I
					have to admit, I was not able to attend many of the meetings due to
					Mock Trial and other conflicts. The meetings focused on current
					events as well as resolutions to many of these topics. Because I
					was in Model UN at my sending school, I was able to talk with ease
					in my council when the MAMS team went to the Mock Model UN held at
					St. John's High School.

				<p>
					Mass Academy students have to fulfill a requirement of minimum 100
					hours of community service; 50 in junior year, 50 in senior year. <br>
					<br> <br> Over the summer, I will be volunteering at a
					program named Intellect Quest. IQ is a place for students from
					grades 5-8 to acquire hands on experience with different workshops,
					which vary from robotics to music and non-STEM related subjects.
					They are geared towards any student who has a quench for knowledge.
					These workshops run from 8:30 am - 3:30 pm. <br> <br> If
					you have any interest or further questions about IQ, please feel
					free to contact me!
