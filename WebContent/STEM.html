					The students at MAMS work on STEM projects, which focus on
					primarily Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. This
					powerpoint will give you a short summary about my project. <br>
					<br> And no, Harvard Yard has nothing to do with my project.<br><br>

				<br>

				<p>The accumulation of greenhouse gasses, such as carbon
					dioxide, poses a severe threat to the environment. A typical
					gasoline vehicle emits about 4.7 metric tons of CO2 per year.
					Renewable energy, such as wind energy, and an increased usage of
					electric vehicles (EV) over gasoline cars are imperative in
					decreasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. This project aimed to
					develop a parking meter that could power eco-friendly EVs using
					clean wind energy. To be effective, this device would require a
					level-2 EV charger capable of charging these vehicles in under four
					hours. A prototype of a Savonius wind turbine was constructed using
					aluminum sheet and wood. The turbine was fixed to an EV charging
					station. A 3.6 V battery and electrical connections were attached
					inside of the station. The prototype was tested using controlled
					wind conditions to determine the average power output. The results
					ranged from 0.61 W - 4.63 W and standard deviation was calculated
					to be between 0.11 - 0.42, demonstrating high precision and
					efficiency. This apparatus epitomizes multi-functionality by
					combining a parking meter and an EV charging station to save space
					and encourage a greater usage of EVs.</p>

				<p>In addition to our STEM Project, we also worked on crafting
					our reports similar to science research papers. A Literature Review
					is a long report that coalesces background information,
					experimentation, and other data into one paper. This is the
					Literature Review for my project.</p>
